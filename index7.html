    <h1>JAWS</h1>
    <img src="book 2.jfif" alt="">
    <p>Jaws is a novel by American writer Peter Benchley, published in 1974. It tells the story of a large great white shark that preys upon a small Long Island resort town and the three men who attempt to kill it. The novel grew out of Benchley's interest in shark attacks after he read about the exploits of Frank Mundus, a shark fisherman from Montauk, New York, in 1964. Doubleday commissioned him to write the novel in 1971, a period when Benchley worked as a freelance journalist.</p>
