    <img src="book 1.jfif" alt="">
    <p>Samuel Langhorne Clemens, known by the pen name Mark Twain, was an American writer, humorist, and essayist. He was praised as the "greatest humorist the United States has produced," with William Faulkner calling him "the father of American literature." Twain's novels include The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, with the latter often called the "Great American Novel." He also wrote A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court and Pudd'nhead Wilson, and co-wrote The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today with Charles Dudley Warner.</p>
